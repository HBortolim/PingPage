# PingPage

## Purpose of It
I decided to start this project to practice more HTML & CSS, alongside Javascript, which is my first project using it.

I wanted to practice and expand my knowledge in DOM Manipulation topics to build more interactive web pages and get more familiar with Javascript.

This project was made through Frontend Mentor and I'm working on building more projects over time, which will be posted here as well.
